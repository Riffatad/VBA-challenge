# VBA-challenge

VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data

# Declare variables

	Declare all variables to be used in this code so we have items to move value through them.
 
# Loop to go through all the sheets in workbook

	Create the first loop that will going to go through all the sheets and output data to summary table.

	After loop the summary table should start from row 2.
	Here also the open year variable will be placed to pick the first value from year open.

# 2nd loop to find the values and moving it into the variables
	This loops is traversing through sheets and based on the ticker will pick the open year and close year 

# Start with an if statement

	The close year variable will pick the last value from year close making sure all values are coming in based for that first ticker.

	All calculations will be done here By each ticker 

	Quarterly Change

	Percentage
			
	Total Stock volume 

# The Values of each of each ticker will be output after calculations by their variables in each row.
  output variables


# Format columns colors based on values in column K that is Quarterly change.
	 We will use if statement if the value is negative color red and if negative then green.

# End of 2nd loop 


# Calculate three categories the Greatest Percent increase, Greatest Percent Decrease & Greatest Volume 

 	If statements for each category
